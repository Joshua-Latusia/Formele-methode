Formele methode project I made during my 3rd year of Computer Science at Avans Hogeschool.
The application is written in C#.

The application makes it possible to create nondeterministic finite automatons (NFA), deterministic finite automaton (DFA), create Regular expressions. It's to do following things with these items:

1. Convert a NFA to a DFA
2. Minize DFA
3. Parsing a regex string to regex object and print the word in and not in the language.
4. Convert a regExp to a NFA using the thompson construction.
5. Visualize all the NFA and DFA using Graphviz.
